# Project #1: It's a Tic Tac Toe!

## Motivation:

This game was created as a part of the learning process at SEI-Eternitiy. The main goals of the project is to be able to build a web application from scratch, apply the programming knowledge that I've aquired, building an application under someone else's specifications, exploring options and creating a well-written README.md file.

### User Stories:

- As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game
- As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
- As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
- As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
- As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
- As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
- As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page
- As a user, I should be able to play sounds when clicking sound button
- As a user, I should be able to mute sounds when clicking mute button

#### Potential Extra Tic Tac Toe Features:

- Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win, lose and tie counter
- Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc)
- Use LocalStorage to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
- Create an AI opponent: teach JavaScript to play an unbeatable game against you
- Make the site fully responsive so that it is playable from a mobile phone
- Display highest scores
- Have multiple theme options
- Allow players to create an account that includes their previous games scores

## Technologies Used:
- **Command Line**: used for interacting with the computer, navigating the filesystem.
- **Source Control**: used for interaction, management and upload changes on code to Git repository
- **Sublime Text Editor**: used for coding with Html, CSS, JQuery and JavaScript
- **Google Chrome Developer Tools**: used to debug and solve problems in the code
- **SweetAlert**: used for modals popups
- **Animate.css**: used for animations

## README Suggestions

- List technologies used
- Link to wireframes and user stories.
- Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
- List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
- Describe how you solved for the winner
- Describe how some of your favorite functions work

## Necessary Deliverables
* Projects are due Thursday, 7/4 at 9am!

- A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repository
- A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning of the project_
- **A `README.md` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, any other useful information etc.
- A **5 minute presentation** in which you answer the following questions:
  - What is the game about?
  - Is there any information you think might help us understand what you built?
  - What features did you include?
    - Make sure to explain anything "new" (things that we didn't cover in class)
  - What was the most difficult part of the project?
  - What was your favourite part to work on?
  - What would you like to add next?
  - Demo of the game

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
- **Use your Developer Tools** (`console.log`, inspector, `alert` statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
  - Some great tutorials for the Developer Tools can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)
- Work through the lessons in class, **ask questions and come to office hours** when you need to. Think about adding relevant code to your Tic Tac Toe game each day, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Check out Tutorial and Documentation resources** at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
- **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

1.  Create a repository on github.com for your project
2.  Clone it to the projects folder on your computer
3.  Add an HTML, CSS, and JS file to the folder
4.  Connect the CSS and JS file to your HTML file and test that they all work
5.  Build the most basic version of your Tic Tac Toe board in HTML and CSS (very little styling, just a first version)
6.  Write the pseudocode for the Tic Tac Toe logic as comments in your JS file
7.  Choose the correct data type for how your Tic Tac Toe board should be represented in JS
8.  Add jQuery to your HTML file if you would like to use it instead of vanilla JavScript.
9.  Begin working on the [user stories](https://github.com/wdi-red-coral/project-1-prompt/blob/master/README.md#user-stories), 1 at a time
10.  Deploy your application to github pages
